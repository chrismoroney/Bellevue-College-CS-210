// CS210 Extra-Credit #1 "Annomated Car"
// Chris Moroney
// This task is the Extra-Credit #1, containing a Car that is to be annomated. What
// I needed to do was to take the coordinates and graphics of the car and modify them
// to appear that the car moves horizontally. By importing graphics, the car was able
// to take shape in the form of coordinates. Then, to actually move the car, I used a for loop
// and replace the original graphics with the background color for the effect of movement.

        // Must start the program by inserting the graphics, meaning that the method requires 
        // an input of containing graphics. The variable g represents this in the 
        // methods.

        panel.setBackground(Color.LIGHT_GRAY);
        Graphics g = panel.getGraphics();
        //nested loop is for moving the car. The x is always increasing, meaning the
        //car will move horizontally. The 30 for the y keeps the car from moving unpredictably
        // and losing shape of the car. The g is just to insert the graphics.
        for(int x=10; x<=200; x++){
            drawCar(x, 30, g);
            //This helps to slow the car down enough to see the car move. If this isn't 
            // here, then the car won't be visible because it moves so fast.
