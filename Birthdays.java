// CS210 Assignment #4 "Birthdays"
// Chris Moroney
// This assignment required me to display different types of return values based on
// what the data in the scanner read. To start, I had to calculate what the start
// date was, which was the today's date. I do this in my countDays function. Next, I had to
// calculate which day each person's birthday falls on, which is also involving the
// countDays function, but also the doBirthdays function below. Finally, I had to 
// distinguish which birthday was sooner, which I simply use an if/ else statement 
// in the main function.

//this is for the scanner ability
